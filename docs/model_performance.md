## Error Analysis

### Most Common Misclassifications

1. Bad Splice (2) misclassified as Fiber Tapping (1): 4.2% of Bad Splice samples
2. Dirty Connector (4) misclassified as Bending Event (3): 3.8% of Dirty Connector samples
3. Fiber Tapping (1) misclassified as Bad Splice (2): 3.5% of Fiber Tapping samples

### Challenging Cases

The model has the most difficulty distinguishing between:
- Bad Splice and Fiber Tapping
- Dirty Connector and Bending Event

These fault types have similar OTDR trace patterns in some cases, making differentiation challenging.

## Model Robustness

### Noise Sensitivity

The model was tested with varying levels of noise added to the input signals:

| Noise Level (SNR) | Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------|
| No noise          | 95.8%    |
| High SNR (20dB)   | 94.2%    |
| Medium SNR (15dB) | 92.5%    |
| Low SNR (10dB)    | 87.3%    |
| Very low SNR (5dB)| 76.1%    |

The model maintains good performance down to medium noise levels (15dB SNR).

### Distance Sensitivity

Performance based on event distance from the OTDR source:

| Distance Range | Accuracy |
|----------------|----------|
| Near (0-0.3)   | 96.7%    |
| Mid (0.3-0.7)  | 95.2%    |
| Far (0.7-1.0)  | 93.8%    |

The model performs slightly better for events closer to the OTDR source.

## Inference Performance

- **Average inference time**: 12ms per sample
- **Throughput**: ~83 predictions per second
- **Memory usage**: 245MB

## Conclusion

The FTTH Fiber Optic Fault Detection model demonstrates excellent performance across all fault types, with an overall accuracy of 95.8%. The model is particularly effective at identifying Fiber Cuts (99% precision) and Normal conditions (98% precision).

Areas for potential improvement include:
1. Better differentiation between Bad Splice and Fiber Tapping events
2. Improved performance for events at greater distances
3. Enhanced robustness to low SNR conditions

## Recommendations

1. **Data augmentation**: Generate additional training samples with varied noise levels to improve robustness.
2. **Feature engineering**: Extract additional features from OTDR traces that better differentiate similar fault types.
3. **Ensemble approach**: Combine multiple models specialized for different distance ranges or fault types.
4. **Regular retraining**: Implement scheduled retraining with new field data to adapt to changing conditions.

### Feature Importance

Analysis of input feature importance using SHAP values:

| Feature      | Importance |
|--------------|------------|
| SNR          | 0.187      |
| P15          | 0.112      |
| P16          | 0.098      |
| P14          | 0.092      |
| P17          | 0.087      |
| P13          | 0.076      |
| P18          | 0.071      |
| ...          | ...        |

The SNR and central trace points (P13-P18) have the highest importance for fault classification.
